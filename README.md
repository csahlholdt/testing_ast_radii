# Jupyter Notebook for "Asteroseismic Radii of Dwarfs: New Accuracy Constraints
From Gaia DR2 Parallaxes"

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook used for the analysis carried out in
the paper "Asteroseismic Radii of Dwarfs: New Accuracy Constraints From Gaia DR2 Parallaxes"

The simplest way to run the notebook is by using the online version:
(Coming Soon)

Alternatively, one can use conda and create an environment
with all the necessary packages based on the file `environment.yml`.
See [the conda documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
for help.
Conda is not required, however, and any python3 installation including the packages
listed in the file `environment.yml` should work.
